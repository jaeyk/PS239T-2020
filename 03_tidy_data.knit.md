# Tidy data and its friends {#tidy_data}

## Setup

-   Check your `dplyr` package is up-to-date by typing `packageVersion("dplyr")`. If the current installed version is less than 1.0, then update by typing `update.packages("dplyr")`. You may need to restart R to make it work.


```r
ifelse(packageVersion("dplyr") >= 1,
  "The installed version of dplyr package is greater than or equal to 1.0.0", update.packages("dplyr")
)
```

```
## [1] "The installed version of dplyr package is greater than or equal to 1.0.0"
```

```r
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
```

```
## Loading required package: pacman
```

```r
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # for the tidyverse framework
  skimr, # for skimming data 
  here, # for computational reproducibility
  infer, # statistical inference 
  tidymodels, # statistical modeling 
  gapminder, # toy data
  nycflights13, # for exercise
  ggthemes, # additional themes
  ggrepel, # arranging ggplots
  patchwork, # arranging ggplots
  broom, # tidying model outputs
  waldo # side-by-side code comparison
)
```

## R Data structures 

To make the best use of the R language, you'll need a strong understanding of the basic data types and data structures and how to operate on those. R is an **object-oriented** language, so the importance of this cannot be understated. 

It is **critical** to understand because these are the objects you will manipulate on a day-to-day basis in R, and they are not always as easy to work with as they sound at the outset. Dealing with object conversions is one of the most common sources of frustration for beginners.

> To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:
  - Everything that exists is an object.
  - Everything that happens is a function call.
  
> __John Chambers__the creator of S (the mother of R)

1. [Main Classes](#main-classes) introduces you to R's one-dimensional or atomic classes and data structures. R has five basic atomic classes: logical, integer, numeric, complex, character. Social scientists don't use complex class. (Also, remember that we rarely use trigonometry.)

2. [Attributes](#attributes) takes a small detour to discuss attributes, R's flexible metadata specification. Here you'll learn about factors, an important data structure created by setting attributes of an atomic vector. R has many data structures: vector, list, matrix, data frame, factors, tables.

## 1D data: Vectors 

### Atomic classes

`R`'s main atomic classes are:

* character (or a "string" in Python and Stata)
* numeric (integer or float)
* integer (just integer)
* logical (booleans)

| Example | Type |
| ------- | ---- |
| "a", "swc" | character |
| 2, 15.5 | numeric | 
| 2 (Must add a `L` at end to denote integer) | integer |
| `TRUE`, `FALSE` | logical |

Like Python, R is dynamically typed. There are a few differences in terminology, however, that are pertinent. 

- First, "types" in Python are referred to as "classes" in R. 

What is a class?

![from https://brilliant.org/](https://ds055uzetaobb.cloudfront.net/brioche/uploads/pJZt3mh3Ht-prettycars.png?width=2400)

- Second, R has some different names for the types string, integer, and float --- specifically **character**, **integer** (not different), and **numeric**. Because there is no "float" class in R, users tend to default to the "numeric" class when they want to work with numerical data.

The function for recovering object classes is ```class()```. L suffix to qualify any number with the intent of making it an explicit integer. See more from the [R language definition](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.html).


```r
class(3)
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

```r
class(3L)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

```r
class("Three")
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

```r
class(F)
```

```
## [1] "logical"
```

### Data structures

R's base data structures can be organized by their dimensionality (1d, 2d, or nd) and whether they're homogeneous (all contents must be of the same type) or heterogeneous (the contents can be of different types). This gives rise to the five data types most often used in data analysis: 

|    | Homogeneous   | Heterogeneous |
|----|---------------|---------------|
| 1d | Atomic vector | List          |
| 2d | Matrix        | Data frame    |
| nd | Array         |               |

Each data structure has its own specifications and behavior. For our purposes, an important thing to remember is that R is always **faster** (more efficient) working with homogeneous (**vectorized**) data.

#### Vector properties

Vectors have three common properties:

* Class, `class()`, or what type of object it is (same as `type()` in Python).
* Length, `length()`, how many elements it contains (same as `len()` in Python).
* Attributes, `attributes()`, additional arbitrary metadata.

They differ in the types of their elements: all elements of an atomic vector must be the same type, whereas the elements of a list can have different types.

#### Creating different types of atomic vectors

Remember, there are four common types of vectors: 
* `logical` 
* `integer` 
* `numeric` (same as `double`)
* `character`.

You can create an empty vector with `vector()` (By default the mode is `logical`. You can be more explicit as shown in the examples below.) It is more common to use direct constructors such as `character()`, `numeric()`, etc.


```r
x <- vector()

# with a length and type
vector("character", length = 10)
```

```
##  [1] "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""
```

```r
## character vector of length 5
character(5)
```

```
## [1] "" "" "" "" ""
```

```r
numeric(5)
```

```
## [1] 0 0 0 0 0
```

```r
logical(5)
```

```
## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
```

Atomic vectors are usually created with `c()`, which is short for concatenate:


```r
x <- c(1, 2, 3)

x
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3
```

```r
length(x)
```

```
## [1] 3
```

`x` is a numeric vector. These are the most common kind. You can also have logical vectors. 


```r
y <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)

y
```

```
## [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
```

Finally you can have character vectors:


```r
kim_family <- c("Jae", "Sun", "Jane")

is.integer(kim_family) # integer?
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

```r
is.character(kim_family) # character?
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
is.atomic(kim_family) # atomic?
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
typeof(kim_family) # what's the type?
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

**Short exercise: Create and examine your vector**  

Create a character vector called `fruit` that contain 4 of your favorite fruits. Then evaluate its structure using the commands below.


```r
# First create your fruit vector
# YOUR CODE HERE
fruit <-

  # Examine your vector
  length(fruit)
class(fruit)
str(fruit)
```

**Add elements**

You can add elements to the end of a vector by passing the original vector into the `c` function, like so:


```r
z <- c("Beyonce", "Kelly", "Michelle", "LeToya")

z <- c(z, "Farrah")

z
```

```
## [1] "Beyonce"  "Kelly"    "Michelle" "LeToya"   "Farrah"
```

More examples of vectors


```r
x <- c(0.5, 0.7)

x <- c(TRUE, FALSE)

x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")

x <- 9:100
```

You can also create vectors as a sequence of numbers:


```r
series <- 1:10

series
```

```
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```

```r
seq(10)
```

```
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```

```r
seq(1, 10, by = 0.1)
```

```
##  [1]  1.0  1.1  1.2  1.3  1.4  1.5  1.6  1.7  1.8  1.9  2.0  2.1  2.2  2.3  2.4
## [16]  2.5  2.6  2.7  2.8  2.9  3.0  3.1  3.2  3.3  3.4  3.5  3.6  3.7  3.8  3.9
## [31]  4.0  4.1  4.2  4.3  4.4  4.5  4.6  4.7  4.8  4.9  5.0  5.1  5.2  5.3  5.4
## [46]  5.5  5.6  5.7  5.8  5.9  6.0  6.1  6.2  6.3  6.4  6.5  6.6  6.7  6.8  6.9
## [61]  7.0  7.1  7.2  7.3  7.4  7.5  7.6  7.7  7.8  7.9  8.0  8.1  8.2  8.3  8.4
## [76]  8.5  8.6  8.7  8.8  8.9  9.0  9.1  9.2  9.3  9.4  9.5  9.6  9.7  9.8  9.9
## [91] 10.0
```

Atomic vectors are always flat, even if you nest `c()`'s:


```r
c(1, c(2, c(3, 4)))
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4
```

```r
# the same as
c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4
```

**Types and Tests**

Given a vector, you can determine its class with `class`, or check if it's a specific type with an "is" function: `is.character()`, `is.numeric()`, `is.integer()`, `is.logical()`, or, more generally, `is.atomic()`.


```r
char_var <- c("harry", "sally")

class(char_var)
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

```r
is.character(char_var)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
is.atomic(char_var)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
num_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)

class(num_var)
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

```r
is.numeric(num_var)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
is.atomic(num_var)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

NB: `is.vector()` does not test if an object is a vector. Instead it returns `TRUE` only if the object is a vector with no attributes apart from names. Use `is.atomic(x) || is.list(x)` to test if an object is actually a vector.

**Coercion**

All elements of an atomic vector must be the same type, so when you attempt to combine different types they will be __coerced__ to the most flexible type. Types from least to most flexible are: logical, integer, double, and character. 

For example, combining a character and an integer yields a character:


```r
str(c("a", 1))
```

```
##  chr [1:2] "a" "1"
```

**Guess what the following do without running them first**


```r
c(1.7, "a")

c(TRUE, 2)

c("a", TRUE)
```

Notice that when a logical vector is coerced to an integer or double, `TRUE` becomes 1 and `FALSE` becomes 0. This is very useful in conjunction with `sum()` and `mean()`


```r
x <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)

as.numeric(x)
```

```
## [1] 0 0 1
```

```r
# Total number of TRUEs
sum(x)
```

```
## [1] 1
```

```r
# Proportion that are TRUE
mean(x)
```

```
## [1] 0.3333333
```

Coercion often happens automatically. This is called implicit coercion. Most mathematical functions (`+`, `log`, `abs`, etc.) will coerce to a numeric or integer, and most logical operations (`&`, `|`, `any`, etc) will coerce to a logical. You will usually get a warning message if the coercion might lose information. 


```r
1 < "2"
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
"1" > 2
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

You can also coerce vectors explicitly coerce with `as.character()`, `as.numeric()`, `as.integer()`, or `as.logical()`. Example:


```r
x <- 0:6

as.numeric(x)
```

```
## [1] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

```r
as.logical(x)
```

```
## [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
```

```r
as.character(x)
```

```
## [1] "0" "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6"
```

Sometimes coercions, especially nonsensical ones, won’t work.


```r
x <- c("a", "b", "c")

as.numeric(x)
```

```
## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion
```

```
## [1] NA NA NA
```

```r
as.logical(x)
```

```
## [1] NA NA NA
```

**Short Exercise**


```r
# 1. Create a vector of a sequence of numbers between 1 to 10.

# 2. Coerce that vector into a character vector

# 3. Add the element "11" to the end of the vector

# 4. Coerce it back to a numeric vector.
```

#### Lists

Lists are also vectors, but different from atomic vectors because their elements can be of any type. In short, they are generic vectors. You construct lists by using `list()` instead of `c()`: 

Lists are sometimes called recursive vectors, because a list can contain other lists. This makes them fundamentally different from atomic vectors. 


```r
x <- list(1, "a", TRUE, c(4, 5, 6))

x
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 1
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] "a"
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] TRUE
## 
## [[4]]
## [1] 4 5 6
```

You can coerce other objects using `as.list()`. You can test for a list with `is.list()`


```r
x <- 1:10

x <- as.list(x)

is.list(x)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
length(x)
```

```
## [1] 10
```

`c()` will combine several lists into one. If given a combination of atomic vectors and lists, `c()` (con**c**atenate) will coerce the vectors to lists before combining them. Compare the results of `list()` and `c()`:


```r
x <- list(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))

y <- c(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))

str(x)
```

```
## List of 2
##  $ :List of 2
##   ..$ : num 1
##   ..$ : num 2
##  $ : num [1:2] 3 4
```

```r
str(y)
```

```
## List of 4
##  $ : num 1
##  $ : num 2
##  $ : num 3
##  $ : num 4
```

You can turn a list into an atomic vector with `unlist()`. If the elements of a list have different types, `unlist()` uses the same coercion rules as `c()`.


```r
x <- list(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))

x
```

```
## [[1]]
## [[1]][[1]]
## [1] 1
## 
## [[1]][[2]]
## [1] 2
## 
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 3 4
```

```r
unlist(x)
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4
```

Lists are used to build up many of the more complicated data structures in R. For example, both data frames and linear models objects (as produced by `lm()`) are lists:


```r
is.list(mtcars)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
mod <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)

is.list(mod)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

For this reason, lists are extremely useful inside functions. You can "staple" together lots of different kinds of results into a single object that a function can return.

A list does not print to the console like a vector. Instead, each element of the list starts on a new line.


```r
x.vec <- c(1, 2, 3)
x.list <- list(1, 2, 3)
x.vec
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3
```

```r
x.list
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 1
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 2
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] 3
```

For lists, elements are **indexed by double brackets**. Single brackets will still return a(nother) list. (We'll talk more about subsetting and indexing in the fourth lesson.)

**Exercises**

1. What are the four basic types of atomic vector? How does a list differ from an
   atomic vector?

2. Why is `1 == "1"` true? Why is `-1 < FALSE` true? Why is `"one" < 2` false?

3. Create three vectors and then combine them into a list.

4.  If `x` is a list, what is the class of `x[1]`?  How about `x[[1]]`?


### Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about the data to you, the user, and to R. We've already seen the following three attributes in action:

* Names (`names(x)`), a character vector giving each element a name. 

* Dimensions (`dim(x)`), used to turn vectors into matrices.

* Class (`class(x)`), used to implement the S3 object system.

**Additional tips**

In an object-oriented system, a [class](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+class+programming&oq=what+is+class+programming&aqs=chrome.0.0l6.3543j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) (an extensible problem-code-template) defines a type of objects like what its properties are, how it behaves, and how it relates to other types of objects. Therefore, technically, an object is an [instance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)) (or occurrence) of a class. A method is a function associated with a particular type of object.

#### Names

You can name a vector when you create it:


```r
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
```

You can also modifying an existing vector: 


```r
x <- 1:3

names(x)
```

```
## NULL
```

```r
names(x) <- c("e", "f", "g")

names(x)
```

```
## [1] "e" "f" "g"
```

Names don't have to be unique. However, character subsetting, described in the next lesson, is the most important reason to use names and it is most useful when the names are unique. (For Python users: when names are unique, a vector behaves kind of like a Python dictionary key.)

Not all elements of a vector need to have a name. If some names are missing, `names()` will return an empty string for those elements. If all names are missing, `names()` will return `NULL`.


```r
y <- c(a = 1, 2, 3)

names(y)
```

```
## [1] "a" ""  ""
```

```r
z <- c(1, 2, 3)

names(z)
```

```
## NULL
```

You can create a new vector without names using `unname(x)`, or remove names in place with `names(x) <- NULL`.

#### Factors

Factors are special vectors that represent categorical data. Factors can be ordered (ordinal variable) or unordered (nominal or categorical variable) and are important for modeling functions such as `lm()` and `glm()` and also in plot methods.

**Quiz**
1. If you want to enter dummy variables (Democrats = 1, Non-democrats = 0) in your regression model, should you use numeric or factor variable?

Factors can only contain pre-defined values. Set allowed values using the `levels()` attribute. Note that a factor's levels will always be character values. 



```r
x <- c("a", "b", "b", "a")

x <- factor(c("a", "b", "b", "a"))

x
```

```
## [1] a b b a
## Levels: a b
```

```r
class(x)
```

```
## [1] "factor"
```

```r
levels(x)
```

```
## [1] "a" "b"
```

```r
# You can't use values that are not in the levels
x[2] <- "c"
```

```
## Warning in `[<-.factor`(`*tmp*`, 2, value = "c"): invalid factor level, NA
## generated
```

```r
# NB: you can't combine factors
c(factor("a"), factor("b"))
```

```
## [1] 1 1
```

```r
rep(1:5, rep(6, 5))
```

```
##  [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 5
```

Factors are pretty much integers that have labels on them. Underneath, it's really numbers (1, 2, 3...). 


```r
x <- factor(c("a", "b", "b", "a"))

str(x)
```

```
##  Factor w/ 2 levels "a","b": 1 2 2 1
```

They are better than using simple integer labels because factors are what are called self describing. For example, `democrat` and `republican` is more descriptive than `1`s and `2`s. 

Factors are useful when you know the possible values a variable may take, even if you don't see all values in a given dataset. Using a factor instead of a character vector makes it obvious when some groups contain no observations:


```r
party_char <- c("democrat", "democrat", "democrat")

party_char
```

```
## [1] "democrat" "democrat" "democrat"
```

```r
party_factor <- factor(party_char, levels = c("democrat", "republican"))

party_factor
```

```
## [1] democrat democrat democrat
## Levels: democrat republican
```

```r
table(party_char) # shows only democrats
```

```
## party_char
## democrat 
##        3
```

```r
table(party_factor) # shows republicans too
```

```
## party_factor
##   democrat republican 
##          3          0
```

Sometimes factors can be left unordered. Example: `democrat`, `republican`.

Other times you might want factors to be ordered (or ranked). Example: `low`, `medium`, `high`. 


```r
x <- factor(c("low", "medium", "high"))

str(x)
```

```
##  Factor w/ 3 levels "high","low","medium": 2 3 1
```

```r
is.ordered(x)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

```r
y <- ordered(c("low", "medium", "high"), levels = c("high", "medium", "low"))

is.ordered(y)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually integers. Be careful when treating them like strings. Some string methods (like `gsub()` and `grepl()`) will coerce factors to strings, while others (like `nchar()`) will throw an error, and still others (like `c()`) will use the underlying integer values. 


```r
x <- c("a", "b", "b", "a")

x
```

```
## [1] "a" "b" "b" "a"
```

```r
is.factor(x)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

```r
x <- as.factor(x)

x
```

```
## [1] a b b a
## Levels: a b
```

```r
c(x, "c")
```

```
## [1] "1" "2" "2" "1" "c"
```

For this reason, it's usually best to explicitly convert factors to character vectors if you need string-like behavior. In early versions of R, there was a memory advantage to using factors instead of character vectors, but this is no longer the case.

Unfortunately, most data loading functions in R automatically convert character vectors to factors. This is suboptimal, because there's no way for those functions to know the set of all possible levels or their optimal order. If this becomes a problem, use the argument `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` to suppress this behavior, and then manually convert character vectors to factors using your knowledge of the data.

**More attributes**

All R objects can have arbitrary additional attributes, used to store metadata about the object. Attributes can be thought of as a named list (with unique names). Attributes can be accessed individually with `attr()` or all at once (as a list) with `attributes()`. 


```r
y <- 1:10

attr(y, "my_attribute") <- "This is a vector"

attr(y, "my_attribute")
```

```
## [1] "This is a vector"
```

```r
# str returns a new object with modified information
str(attributes(y))
```

```
## List of 1
##  $ my_attribute: chr "This is a vector"
```

**Exercises**

1.  What happens to a factor when you modify its levels? 
    

```r
f1 <- factor(letters)

levels(f1) <- rev(levels(f1))

f1
```

```
##  [1] z y x w v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a
## Levels: z y x w v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a
```

2.  What does this code do? How do `f2` and `f3` differ from `f1`?


```r
f2 <- rev(factor(letters))

f3 <- factor(letters, levels = rev(letters))
```

## 2D data: matrices and dataframes 

1. Matrices:  data structures for storing 2d data that is all the same class.
2. Dataframes: teaches you about the dataframe, the most important data structure for storing data in R, because it stores different kinds of (2d) data.

### Matrices

Matrices are created when we combine multiple vectors that all have the same class (e.g., numeric). This creates a dataset with rows and columns. By definition, if you want to combine multiple classes of vectors, you want a dataframe. You can coerce a matrix to become a dataframe, and vice-versa, but as with all vector coercions, the results can be unpredictable, so be sure you know how each variable (column) will convert.


```r
m <- matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 2)

m
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]   NA   NA
## [2,]   NA   NA
```

```r
dim(m)
```

```
## [1] 2 2
```

Matrices are filled column-wise. 


```r
m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)

m
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    3    5
## [2,]    2    4    6
```

Other ways to construct a matrix


```r
m <- 1:10

dim(m) <- c(2, 5)

m
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
## [1,]    1    3    5    7    9
## [2,]    2    4    6    8   10
```

```r
dim(m) <- c(5, 2)

m
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    6
## [2,]    2    7
## [3,]    3    8
## [4,]    4    9
## [5,]    5   10
```

You can transpose a matrix (or dataframe) with `t()`


```r
m <- 1:10

dim(m) <- c(2, 5)

m
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
## [1,]    1    3    5    7    9
## [2,]    2    4    6    8   10
```

```r
t(m)
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    2
## [2,]    3    4
## [3,]    5    6
## [4,]    7    8
## [5,]    9   10
```

Another way is to bind columns or rows using `cbind()` and `rbind()`.


```r
x <- 1:3

y <- 10:12

cbind(x, y)
```

```
##      x  y
## [1,] 1 10
## [2,] 2 11
## [3,] 3 12
```

```r
# or

rbind(x, y)
```

```
##   [,1] [,2] [,3]
## x    1    2    3
## y   10   11   12
```

You can also use the `byrow` argument to specify how the matrix is filled. From R's own documentation:


```r
mdat <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13),
  nrow = 2,
  ncol = 3,
  byrow = TRUE,
  dimnames = list(
    c("row1", "row2"),
    c("C.1", "C.2", "C.3")
  )
)
mdat
```

```
##      C.1 C.2 C.3
## row1   1   2   3
## row2  11  12  13
```

Notice that we gave `names` to the dimensions in `mdat`.


```r
dimnames(mdat)
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "row1" "row2"
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] "C.1" "C.2" "C.3"
```

```r
rownames(mdat)
```

```
## [1] "row1" "row2"
```

```r
colnames(mdat)
```

```
## [1] "C.1" "C.2" "C.3"
```

### Dataframes 

A data frame is a very important data type in R. It's pretty much the **de facto** data structure for most tabular data and what we use for statistics. 

#### Creation

You create a data frame using `data.frame()`, which takes named vectors as input:


```r
vec1 <- 1:3
vec2 <- c("a", "b", "c")
df <- data.frame(vec1, vec2)
df
```

```
##   vec1 vec2
## 1    1    a
## 2    2    b
## 3    3    c
```

```r
str(df)
```

```
## 'data.frame':	3 obs. of  2 variables:
##  $ vec1: int  1 2 3
##  $ vec2: chr  "a" "b" "c"
```

Beware: `data.frame()`'s default behavior which turns strings into factors. Remember to use `stringAsFactors = FALSE` to suppress this behavior as needed:


```r
df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:3,
  y = c("a", "b", "c"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
str(df)
```

```
## 'data.frame':	3 obs. of  2 variables:
##  $ x: int  1 2 3
##  $ y: chr  "a" "b" "c"
```

In reality, we rarely type up our datasets ourselves, and certainly not in R. The most common way to make a data.frame is by calling a file using `read.csv` (which relies on the `foreign` package), `read.dta` (if you're using a Stata file), or some other kind of data file input.

#### Structure and Attributes

Under the hood, a data frame is a list of equal-length vectors. This makes it a 2-dimensional structure, so it shares properties of both the matrix and the list. 


```r
vec1 <- 1:3
vec2 <- c("a", "b", "c")
df <- data.frame(vec1, vec2)

str(df)
```

```
## 'data.frame':	3 obs. of  2 variables:
##  $ vec1: int  1 2 3
##  $ vec2: chr  "a" "b" "c"
```

This means that a dataframe has `names()`, `colnames()`, and `rownames()`, although `names()` and `colnames()` are the same thing. 

** Summary **

- Set column names: `names()` in data frame, `colnames()` in matrix 
- Set row names: `row.names()` in data frame, `rownames()` in matrix


```r
vec1 <- 1:3
vec2 <- c("a", "b", "c")
df <- data.frame(vec1, vec2)

# these two are equivalent
names(df)
```

```
## [1] "vec1" "vec2"
```

```r
colnames(df)
```

```
## [1] "vec1" "vec2"
```

```r
# change the colnames
colnames(df) <- c("Number", "Character")
df
```

```
##   Number Character
## 1      1         a
## 2      2         b
## 3      3         c
```


```r
names(df) <- c("Number", "Character")
df
```

```
##   Number Character
## 1      1         a
## 2      2         b
## 3      3         c
```


```r
# change the rownames
rownames(df)
```

```
## [1] "1" "2" "3"
```

```r
rownames(df) <- c("donut", "pickle", "pretzel")
df
```

```
##         Number Character
## donut        1         a
## pickle       2         b
## pretzel      3         c
```

The `length()` of a dataframe is the length of the underlying list and so is the same as `ncol()`; `nrow()` gives the number of rows. 


```r
vec1 <- 1:3
vec2 <- c("a", "b", "c")
df <- data.frame(vec1, vec2)

# these two are equivalent - number of columns
length(df)
```

```
## [1] 2
```

```r
ncol(df)
```

```
## [1] 2
```

```r
# get number of rows
nrow(df)
```

```
## [1] 3
```

```r
# get number of both columns and rows
dim(df)
```

```
## [1] 3 2
```

#### Testing and coercion

To check if an object is a dataframe, use `class()` or test explicitly with `is.data.frame()`:


```r
class(df)
```

```
## [1] "data.frame"
```

```r
is.data.frame(df)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

You can coerce an object to a dataframe with `as.data.frame()`:

* A vector will create a one-column dataframe.

* A list will create one column for each element; it's an error if they're 
  not all the same length.
  
* A matrix will create a data frame with the same number of columns and rows as the matrix.

#### Combining dataframes

You can combine dataframes using `cbind()` and `rbind()`:


```r
df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:3,
  y = c("a", "b", "c"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

cbind(df, data.frame(z = 3:1))
```

```
##   x y z
## 1 1 a 3
## 2 2 b 2
## 3 3 c 1
```

```r
rbind(df, data.frame(x = 10, y = "z"))
```

```
##    x y
## 1  1 a
## 2  2 b
## 3  3 c
## 4 10 z
```

When combining column-wise, the number of rows must match, but row names are ignored. When combining row-wise, both the number and names of columns must match. (If you want to combine rows that don't have the same columns, there are other functions / packages in R that can help.)

It's a common mistake to try and create a dataframe by `cbind()`ing vectors together. This doesn't work because `cbind()` will create a matrix unless one of the arguments is already a dataframe. Instead use `data.frame()` directly:


```r
bad <- (cbind(x = 1:2, y = c("a", "b")))
bad
```

```
##      x   y  
## [1,] "1" "a"
## [2,] "2" "b"
```

```r
str(bad)
```

```
##  chr [1:2, 1:2] "1" "2" "a" "b"
##  - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
##   ..$ : NULL
##   ..$ : chr [1:2] "x" "y"
```

```r
good <- data.frame(
  x = 1:2, y = c("a", "b"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
good
```

```
##   x y
## 1 1 a
## 2 2 b
```

```r
str(good)
```

```
## 'data.frame':	2 obs. of  2 variables:
##  $ x: int  1 2
##  $ y: chr  "a" "b"
```

The conversion rules for `cbind()` are complicated and best avoided by ensuring all inputs are of the same type.

#### List columns (TBD)

**Other objects**

Missing values are specified with `NA`, which is a logical vector of length 1. `NA` will always be coerced to the correct type if used inside `c()`


```r
x <- c(NA, 1)
x
```

```
## [1] NA  1
```

```r
typeof(NA)
```

```
## [1] "logical"
```

```r
typeof(x)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```

`Inf` is infinity. You can have either positive or negative infinity.


```r
1 / 0
```

```
## [1] Inf
```

```r
1 / Inf
```

```
## [1] 0
```

`NaN` means Not a number. It's an undefined value.


```r
0 / 0
```

```
## [1] NaN
```

## Subset

When working with data, you'll need to subset objects early and often. Luckily, R's subsetting operators are powerful and fast. Mastery of subsetting allows you to succinctly express complex operations in a way that few other languages can match. Subsetting is hard to learn because you need to master a number of interrelated concepts:

* The three subsetting operators, `[`, `[[`, and `$`.

* Important differences in behavior for different objects (e.g., vectors, lists, factors, matrices, and data frames).

* The use of subsetting in conjunction with assignment.

This unit helps you master subsetting by starting with the simplest type of subsetting: subsetting an atomic vector with `[`. It then gradually extends your knowledge, first to more complicated data types (like dataframes and lists), and then to the other subsetting operators, `[[` and `$`. You'll then learn how subsetting and assignment can be combined to modify parts of an object, and, finally, you'll see a large number of useful applications.

### Atomic vectors

Let's explore the different types of subsetting with a simple vector, `x`. 


```r
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)
```

Note that the number after the decimal point gives the original position in the vector.

**NB:** In R, positions start at 1, unlike Python, which starts at 0. Fun!**

There are five things that you can use to subset a vector: 

#### Positive integers


```r
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)
x
```

```
## [1] 2.1 4.2 3.3 5.4
```

```r
x[1]
```

```
## [1] 2.1
```

```r
x[c(3, 1)]
```

```
## [1] 3.3 2.1
```

```r
# `order(x)` gives the positions of smallest to largest values.
order(x)
```

```
## [1] 1 3 2 4
```

```r
x[order(x)]
```

```
## [1] 2.1 3.3 4.2 5.4
```

```r
x[c(1, 3, 2, 4)]
```

```
## [1] 2.1 3.3 4.2 5.4
```

```r
# Duplicated indices yield duplicated values
x[c(1, 1)]
```

```
## [1] 2.1 2.1
```

#### Negative integers


```r
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)
x[-1]
```

```
## [1] 4.2 3.3 5.4
```

```r
x[-c(3, 1)]
```

```
## [1] 4.2 5.4
```

You can't mix positive and negative integers in a single subset:


```r
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)
x[c(-1, 2)]
```

```
## Error in x[c(-1, 2)]: only 0's may be mixed with negative subscripts
```

#### Logical vectors


```r
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)

x[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]
```

```
## [1] 2.1 4.2
```

This is probably the most useful type of subsetting because you write the expression that creates the logical vector


```r
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)

# this returns a logical vector
x > 3
```

```
## [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
```

```r
x
```

```
## [1] 2.1 4.2 3.3 5.4
```

```r
# use a conditional statement to create an implicit logical vector
x[x > 3]
```

```
## [1] 4.2 3.3 5.4
```

You can combine conditional statements with `&` (and), `|` (or), and `!` (not)


```r
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)

# combing two conditional statements with &
x > 3 & x < 5
```

```
## [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
```

```r
x[x > 3 & x < 5]
```

```
## [1] 4.2 3.3
```

```r
# combing two conditional statements with |
x < 3 | x > 5
```

```
## [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
```

```r
x[x < 3 | x > 5]
```

```
## [1] 2.1 5.4
```

```r
# combining conditional statements with !
!x > 5
```

```
## [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
```

```r
x[!x > 5]
```

```
## [1] 2.1 4.2 3.3
```

Another way to generate implicit conditional statements is using the `%in%` operator, which works like the `in` keywords in Python.


```r
# generate implicit logical vectors through the %in% operator
x %in% c(3.3, 4.2)
```

```
## [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
```

```r
x
```

```
## [1] 2.1 4.2 3.3 5.4
```

```r
x[x %in% c(3.3, 4.2)]
```

```
## [1] 4.2 3.3
```

#### Character vectors


```r
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)

# apply names
names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
x
```

```
##   a   b   c   d 
## 2.1 4.2 3.3 5.4
```

```r
# subset using names
x[c("d", "c", "a")]
```

```
##   d   c   a 
## 5.4 3.3 2.1
```

```r
# Like integer indices, you can repeat indices
x[c("a", "a", "a")]
```

```
##   a   a   a 
## 2.1 2.1 2.1
```

```r
# Careful! names are always matched exactly
x <- c(abc = 1, def = 2)
x
```

```
## abc def 
##   1   2
```

```r
x[c("a", "d")]
```

```
## <NA> <NA> 
##   NA   NA
```

###### More on string operations 


```r
firstName <- "Jae Yeon"
lastName <- "Kim"
```

Unlike in Python, R does not have a reserved operator for string concatenation such as `+`.  Furthermore, using the usual concatenation operator ```c()``` on two or more character strings will not create a single character string, but rather a **vector** of character strings. 


```r
fullName <- c(firstName, lastName)

print(fullName)
```

```
## [1] "Jae Yeon" "Kim"
```

```r
length(fullName)
```

```
## [1] 2
```

In order to combine two or more character strings into one larger character string, we use the ```paste()``` function.  This function takes character strings or vectors and collapses their values into a single character string, with each value separated by a character string selected by the user.


```r
fullName <- paste(firstName, lastName)

print(fullName)

fullName <- paste(firstName, lastName, sep = "+")

print(fullName)

fullName <- paste(firstName, lastName, sep = "___")
print(fullName)
```

As with Python, R can also extract substrings based on the index position of its characters.  There are, however, two critical differences.  First, **index positions in R start at 1**.  This is in contrast to Python, where indexation starts at 0.  

Second, **object subsets using index positions in R contain all the elements in the specified range**.  If some object called ```data``` contains five elements, ```data[2:4]``` will return the elements at the second, third, and fourth positions.  By contrast, the same subset in Python would return the objects at the third and fourth positions (or second and third positions, depending upon whether your index starts at 0 or 1).  

Third, **R does not allow indexing of character strings***. Instead, you must use the ```substr()``` function.  Note that this function must receive both the ```start``` and ```stop``` arguments.  So if you want to get all the characters between some index and the end of the string, you must make use of the ```nchar()``` function, which will tell you the length of a character string.


```r
fullName <- paste(firstName, lastName)

# this won't work like in Python
fullName[1] # R sees the string as a unitary object - it can't be indexed this way
```

```
## [1] "Jae Yeon Kim"
```

```r
fullName[1:4]
```

```
## [1] "Jae Yeon Kim" NA             NA             NA
```

```r
# So use this instead
substr(x = fullName, start = 1, stop = 2)
```

```
## [1] "Ja"
```

```r
substr(x = fullName, start = 5, stop = 5)
```

```
## [1] "Y"
```

```r
substr(x = fullName, start = 1, stop = 10)
```

```
## [1] "Jae Yeon K"
```

```r
substr(x = fullName, start = 11, stop = nchar(fullName))
```

```
## [1] "im"
```

Like Python, R has a number of string methods, though these exist as individual rather than "mix-and-match" functions. For example:


```r
toupper(x = fullName)
```

```
## [1] "JAE YEON KIM"
```

```r
tolower(x = fullName)
```

```
## [1] "jae yeon kim"
```

```r
strsplit(x = fullName, split = " ")
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "Jae"  "Yeon" "Kim"
```

```r
strsplit(x = fullName, split = "n")
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "Jae Yeo" " Kim"
```

```r
gsub(pattern = "Kim", replacement = "Choi", x = fullName)
```

```
## [1] "Jae Yeon Choi"
```

```r
gsub(pattern = "Jae Yeon", replacement = "Danny", x = fullName)
```

```
## [1] "Danny Kim"
```

```r
# Note the importance of cases! This doesn't throw an error, so you won't realize your function didn't work unless you double-check several entries

gsub(pattern = " ", replacement = "", x = fullName) # The same function is used for replacements and stripping
```

```
## [1] "JaeYeonKim"
```

### Lists

Subsetting a list works in the same way as subsetting an atomic vector. Using `[` will always return a list; `[[` and `$`, as described below, let you pull out the components of the list.


```r
l <- list("a" = 1, "b" = 2)
l
```

```
## $a
## [1] 1
## 
## $b
## [1] 2
```

```r
l[1]
```

```
## $a
## [1] 1
```

```r
l[[1]]
```

```
## [1] 1
```

```r
l["a"]
```

```
## $a
## [1] 1
```

### Matrices

The most common way of subsetting matrices (2d) is a simple generalization of 1d subsetting: you supply a 1d index for each dimension, separated by a comma. Blank subsetting is now useful because it lets you keep all rows or all columns.


```r
a <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
colnames(a) <- c("A", "B", "C")
a
```

```
##      A B C
## [1,] 1 4 7
## [2,] 2 5 8
## [3,] 3 6 9
```

```r
# rows come first, then columns
a[c(1, 2), ]
```

```
##      A B C
## [1,] 1 4 7
## [2,] 2 5 8
```

```r
a[c(T, F, T), c("B", "A")]
```

```
##      B A
## [1,] 4 1
## [2,] 6 3
```

```r
a[0, -2]
```

```
##      A C
```

```r
a[c(1, 2), -2]
```

```
##      A C
## [1,] 1 7
## [2,] 2 8
```

### Data frames

Data from data frames can be addressed like matrices (with row and column indicators separated by a comma).


```r
df <- data.frame(x = 4:6, y = 3:1, z = letters[1:3])
df
```

```
##   x y z
## 1 4 3 a
## 2 5 2 b
## 3 6 1 c
```

```r
# return only the rows where x == 6
df[df$x == 6, ]
```

```
##   x y z
## 3 6 1 c
```

```r
# return the first and third row
df[c(1, 3), ]
```

```
##   x y z
## 1 4 3 a
## 3 6 1 c
```

```r
# return the first and third row, and the first and second column
df[c(1, 3), c(1, 2)]
```

```
##   x y
## 1 4 3
## 3 6 1
```

Data frames possess the characteristics of both lists and matrices: if you subset with a single vector, they behave like lists, and return only the columns.


```r
# There are two ways to select columns from a data frame
# Like a list:
df[c("x", "z")]
```

```
##   x z
## 1 4 a
## 2 5 b
## 3 6 c
```

```r
# Like a matrix
df[, c("x", "z")]
```

```
##   x z
## 1 4 a
## 2 5 b
## 3 6 c
```

But there's an important difference when you select a single column: matrix subsetting simplifies by default, list subsetting does not.


```r
(df["x"])
```

```
##   x
## 1 4
## 2 5
## 3 6
```

```r
class((df["x"]))
```

```
## [1] "data.frame"
```

```r
(df[, "x"])
```

```
## [1] 4 5 6
```

```r
class((df[, "x"]))
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

See the bottom section on [Simplying and Preserving to know more](#simplify-preserve)

### Subsetting operators 

There are two other subsetting operators: `[[` and `$`. 

* `[[` is similar to `[`, except it can only return a single value and it allows you to pull pieces out of a list. 
* `$` is a useful shorthand for `[[` combined with character subsetting. 

##### `[[`

You need `[[` when working with lists. This is because when `[` is applied to a list it always returns a list: it never gives you the contents of the list. To get the contents, you need `[[`:

>  "If list `x` is a train carrying objects, then `x[[5]]` is
> the object in car 5; `x[4:6]` is a train of cars 4-6." 
>
> --- @RLangTip

Because data frames are lists of columns, you can use `[[` to extract a column from data frames:


```r
mtcars
```

##### `$`

`$` is a shorthand operator, where `x$y` is equivalent to `x[["y", exact = FALSE]]`.  It's often used to access variables in a data frame:


```r
# these two are equivalent
mtcars[["cyl"]]
```

```
##  [1] 6 6 4 6 8 6 8 4 4 6 6 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 4 4 4 8 6 8 4
```

```r
mtcars$cyl
```

```
##  [1] 6 6 4 6 8 6 8 4 4 6 6 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 4 4 4 8 6 8 4
```

One common mistake with `$` is to try and use it when you have the name of a column stored in a variable:


```r
var <- "cyl"
# Doesn't work - mtcars$var translated to mtcars[["var"]]
mtcars$var
```

```
## NULL
```

```r
# Instead use [[
mtcars[[var]]
```

```
##  [1] 6 6 4 6 8 6 8 4 4 6 6 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 4 4 4 8 6 8 4
```

### Subassignment

All subsetting operators can be combined with assignment to modify selected values of the input vector.


```r
x <- 1:5
x
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5
```

```r
x[c(1, 2)] <- 2:3
x
```

```
## [1] 2 3 3 4 5
```

```r
# The length of the LHS needs to match the RHS!
x[-1] <- 4:1
x
```

```
## [1] 2 4 3 2 1
```

```r
x[1] <- 4:1
```

```
## Warning in x[1] <- 4:1: number of items to replace is not a multiple of
## replacement length
```

```r
# This is mostly useful when conditionally modifying vectors
df <- data.frame(a = c(1, 10, NA))
df
```

```
##    a
## 1  1
## 2 10
## 3 NA
```

```r
df$a[df$a < 5] <- 0
df
```

```
##    a
## 1  0
## 2 10
## 3 NA
```

## Tidyverse

* I adapted the following content from Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html), his [earlier paper](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper) published in the Journal of Statistical Software, [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/) by Gillespie and Lovelace, and [R Programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/) by Roger P. Peng.

-   [Tidyverse design guide](https://design.tidyverse.org/unifying-principles.html)

    -   Human centered

    -   Consistent

    -   Composable (modualized)

    -   Inclusive

    -   Influenced by the [Basics of the Unix Philosophy](https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/~thenry/resources/unix_art/ch01s06.html), [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), and the [Design Principles Behind Smalltalk](https://refs.devinmcgloin.com/smalltalk/Design-Principles-Behind-Smalltalk.pdf)

## Tidy data

> "Tidy data sets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table." - Hadley Wickham

1.  Variables -\> **Columns**
2.  Observations -\> **Rows**
3.  Values -\> **Cells**

![Tidy Data Example (Source: R for Data Science)](https://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-1.png)

If dataframes are tidy, it's easy to transform, visualize, model, and program them using tidyverse packages (a whole workflow).

![Tidyverse: an opinionated collection of R packages](https://miro.medium.com/max/960/0*mlPyX0NE0WQwEzpS.png)

-   Nevertheless, don't be **religious**.

> In summary, tidy data is a useful conceptual idea and is often the right way to go for general, small data sets, but may not be appropriate for all problems. - Jeff Leek

For instance, in many data science applications, linear algebra-based computations are essential (e.g., [Principal Component Analysis](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~kazdan/312S13/JJ/PCA-JJ.pdf)). These computations are optimized to work on matrices, not tidy data frames (for more information, read [Jeff Leek's blog post](https://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/17/non-tidy-data/)).

This is what a tidy data looks like.


```r
library(tidyverse)

table1
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 4
##   country      year  cases population
##   <chr>       <int>  <int>      <int>
## 1 Afghanistan  1999    745   19987071
## 2 Afghanistan  2000   2666   20595360
## 3 Brazil       1999  37737  172006362
## 4 Brazil       2000  80488  174504898
## 5 China        1999 212258 1272915272
## 6 China        2000 213766 1280428583
```


**Additional tips** 

There are so many different ways of taking a look at data in R. Can you discuss the pros and cons of each approach? Which one do you prefer and why?
